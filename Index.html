        <p class="Question">
            Seeing as we’re still in the throes of a pandemic, we should probably start with the obvious: How’s your health?
        </p>
        <p class="TwoD">
            2D: Yeah I’m OK cheers for asking. Russ and Noodle are good too, but it’s hard to tell with Murdoc as he always looks green and not well. It’s the same with kiwis, how do you know if they’ve gone mouldy if they are green in the first place? The only way to know is by eating them, like yesterday when I ate this kiwi which turned out to be a really old lemon.
        </p>
        <p class="Question">
            2021 marks the 20 year anniversary of Gorillaz. How did you celebrate? What’s your idea of a good party?
        </p>
        <p class="Murdoc">
        Murdoc: Please don’t use the ‘p’ word. Gets me all choked up, harking back to the good old days when a knees-up meant packing a thousand A-listers into a glitzy venue, then waking up two weeks later on a different continent with some new tattoos, a mysterious surgical scar, and multiple arrest warrants in my name. That not being an option, we stayed in and played Minecraft.
        </p>
        
        <p class="Question">
            We’re here because you’re collaborating with Fred Perry. What excites you about fashion and who’s the most stylish member of the group?
        </p>
        <p class="TwoD">
            2D: Fashion has been keeping humans warm since our ancestors in caves all them hundreds of years ago who used to wear little shorts made of hair. Noodle and Russel are the most stylish, then Mike the Monkey, then Ace, then probably my pet worm, Alvin.
        </p>
        
        <p class="Question">
        You’ve always been prophetic—looking back at Gorillaz 20 years on, what was the most prescient lyric or moment on the album? 
        </p>
        <p class="Murdoc">
            Murdoc: I knew you were going to ask that question. That’s how prophetic I am. I mean, look no further than ‘Tomorrow Comes Today’. In our first chuffing single we were whacking out warnings like ’The digital won’t let me go’. Gorillaz has been calling it, right from the start.
        </p>
        
        <p class="Question">
                In the kindest way possible, you’re getting on a bit, but barely ageing. What’s your secret? When are you dropping the skincare routines?
        </p>
        <p class="TwoD">
            2D: Russ made this moisturiser which I found to be a bit burny when rubbed into my face and thighs, but it tastes well nice in a burrito. A good way to stay young is to do things slowly, like walking and thinking, that way time goes slower and you stay younger for longer.
        </p>
        
        <p class="Question">
            2D learnt a bit of french for his collab with Fatoumata Diawara last year, have the rest of you picked up any new skills in lockdown? 
        </p>
        <p class="Murdoc">
            Murdoc: Banged out a few more chapters of my memoirs, Murdoc Most Foul. Really harrowing stuff. What else… Oh yeah, 2D and I are attempting to play the world’s longest running game of noughts and crosses. Currently it’s his move. He’s been mulling it over since September. Can’t wait to see what the lad’s got up his sleeve.
        </p>
        
        <p class="Question">
            2020 was a wake up call in many ways for many people—Murdoc, do you relate? Any revelations? Any personal growth? 
        </p>
        <p class="Murdoc">
            Murdoc: Bollocks to personal growth, just surviving 2020 was a win. A year that will go down in infamy. Any revelations? Sure. Being in a band and not being allowed to play in front of fans is a dreadful state of affairs. Never thought I’d say this, but we need each other.
        </p>
        
        <p class="Question">
            Just between us, who’s the biggest diva you’ve ever collabed with?
        </p>
        <p class="Murdoc">
            Murdoc: Just so we’re clear, diva is not a dirty word, it’s a badge of honour. I’ve worked with some of the greatest divas of modern times. I’ll even hold my own hands up.   
        </p>
                
        <p class="Question">
            What do you have planned for the Song Machine tour—is it happening? 
        </p>
        <p class="TwoD">
            2D: I hope so, because not doing shows is quite boring. It was OK at first, like when you bunk off school to go and sit in your mate Dave’s caravan. But after a bit you realise there’s nothing to do and it smells weird.
        </p>
                
        <p class="Question">
            Now that the American idiot is out of the way, who is most grinding your gears? Thoughts on Boris Johnson?
        </p>
        <p class="TwoD">
            2D: I try not to have too many thoughts on other people. Russel says it’s better to look inward. Except when using stairs or driving a car, when I’ve found it’s better to look outward.
        </p>
           
        <p class="Question">
            How’s Madge doing? 
        </p>
        <p class="Murdoc">
            Murdoc: My yak? She’s all good mate. In her usual spot mounted on the wall, staring stoically at the snooker table. I combed her whiskers just the other week. Tbh I was devastated last year when Madge passed, but actually after a while I started to appreciate all the extra time and money I’d gained from not having to care for a half-ton of wild cow in West London. Lovely sweet disposition, but eff me, she could eat. Nearly bankrupted myself on Deliveroo.
